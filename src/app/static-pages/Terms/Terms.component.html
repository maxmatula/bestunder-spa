      transported by air and involves a stop in a country other than the country of departure, you understand and
      acknowledge that an Airfreight Convention may apply and may limit liability for loss or damage. Your claim for any
      loss or damage occurring during carriage by air, is against the airline carrier.In the event of any loss or damage

      payable under the applicable Airfreight Convention on your behalf, and you indemnify Aramex and hold it harmless
      against any claims for loss or damage to your Goods incurred while they were in the possession of the airline

      is so, and no international treaty is applicable which covers the additional transport, your recovery of loss or
      damage, if any, is against the carrier and may exclude or substantially limit liability. In the event of any loss
      or damage suffered by you while the Goods are in the possession of a third party carrier, Aramex will seek to
      recover from the carrier any amounts payable to you. You indemnify Aramex and hold it harmless against any claims
      for loss or damage to your Goods incurred while they are in the possession of the third party carrier, where such
